# Getting Started

Lets get started with a few easy rooms which will give you practice in the following areas:

1. Active Reconnaissance Vulnerability Scanning&#x20;
2. Vulnerability Scanning
3. Privilege Escalation&#x20;
4. Web Application Attacks&#x20;

Its important to take notes when attacking machines, as you will usually be required to explain the vulnerabilities to both a technical and non technical audience. To get practice, why not take notes or write a blog post for each room you complete?
